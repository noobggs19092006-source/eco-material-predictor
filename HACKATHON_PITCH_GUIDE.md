# 🏆 Eco-Material Predictor — Hackathon Pitch Guide

This is your complete, start-to-finish cheat sheet. Covers what we built, the science behind it, how to explain the graphs to judges, and how to run the live demo.

## 1. The Core Problem 🌍
Discovering new eco-friendly materials (biodegradable plastics, green alloys) requires months of physical lab testing just to know if a material is strong enough. We eliminate that wait.

## 2. Our Solution 💡
**The AI Innovation Engine.** Input 10 basic chemical characteristics of a theoretical material → our ML pipeline instantly predicts **10 complex physical properties** (Tensile Strength, Tg, Young's Modulus, etc.) with R² > 0.90 accuracy.

---

## 3. The Dataset & Samples 🧪

- **285 distinct materials** — PLA, PHA, PHB, PBS, PEF, Bio-PA, Cellulose, Lignin, Chitosan, metal alloys and 160+ more.
- Sources: QSPR literature, Matmatch, CAMPUS Plastics databases.
- **2% realistic lab noise** injected so the AI learns to handle real-world imperfect data (not just idealised formulas).
- **Strict 70/10/20 split** — 20% of materials locked in a blind vault the AI never saw during training. All R² scores come from those locked samples only.

## 4. The 10 Input Features 🧬

| # | Feature | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `repeat_unit_MW` | Molecular weight of the polymer's base unit |
| 2 | `backbone_flexibility` | 0 = rigid glass, 1 = flexible rubber |
| 3 | `polarity_index` | 0 = nonpolar, 3 = highly polar |
| 4 | `hydrogen_bond_capacity` | How strongly molecules grip each other (0–5) |
| 5 | `aromatic_content` | Fraction of stable carbon rings (0–1) |
| 6 | `crystallinity_tendency` | 0 = messy/amorphous, 1 = perfectly crystalline |
| 7 | `eco_score` | 0 = pure petroleum, 1 = 100% bio-based |
| 8 | `is_alloy` | 0 = polymer, 1 = metal alloy |
| 9 | `mw_flexibility` | Derived: MW × flexibility (interaction feature) |
| 10 | `polar_hbond` | Derived: polarity × H-bond (interaction feature) |

## 5. The AI Architecture: Stacked Ensembles 🤖

```
Random Forest ──┐
                ├──► Ridge Meta-Learner ──► 10 Property Predictions ± Confidence
XGBoost ────────┘
```

- **Two completely separate brains** — one for Polymers, one for Alloys (auto-routed)
- **Random Forest** builds hundreds of decision trees
- **XGBoost** learns iteratively from its own mistakes
- **Ridge Meta-Learner** combines both — learns *when* to trust each model
- Result: ultra-stable predictions that respect real physics

## 6. The Web Application 🌐

**Run it:**
```bash
make app
# API → http://localhost:8000
# Web → http://localhost:5173
```

### What the judges see on screen:

**✨ UI Features to Point Out:**
- **Liquid-Glass 3D Parallax:** Move your mouse over the cards. Explain that the entire UI reacts dynamically to user movement to make the data feel tactile and premium.

**🔬 Property Predictor page:**
- 7 interactive sliders (Material Composition panel)
- Click **⚡ Run Ensemble Prediction**
- RIGHT column shows simultaneously:
  - **🕸 Material DNA Radar Chart** — 6 properties as a filled spider polygon (dynamically auto-scales for Polymers vs Alloys)
  - **📊 4 CountUp metric cards** — Tensile, Tg, Young's Modulus, Density with ± confidence
  - **📋 Full 10-property table** — all values with error margins

**🌱 Green Recommender page:**
- Designed with **High-Contrast Neon Cyan** for projector visibility from the back of the room.
- Type any petroleum plastic (e.g. "ABS") in the search box
- Click **🌱 Find Alternatives**
- Instantly shows 3 100%-bio-based alternatives with:
  - **True Multivariate Match % Ring** — Not just one property, but a combined mathematical distance across 5 structural requirements (Tensile, Young's, Tg, Density, Elongation).
  - Property comparison with ▲/▼ deltas vs the petroleum material

## 7. The 5 Graphs Explained 📊
*(Generated by `make evaluate`, saved to `results/`)*

### Graph 1: Actual vs Predicted
**What you say:** *"This scatter plot is the proof our AI works on blind data. The X-axis is the real lab value, Y-axis is our AI's prediction. The dots form a near-perfect 45° line — our AI matches reality with R² > 0.90."*

### Graph 2: Feature Importance Heatmap
**What you say:** *"This shows exactly what the AI is thinking. It proves our AI learned real physics — it correctly learned that Aromatic Content dramatically increases Glass Transition Temperature."*

### Graph 3: Property Correlation Matrix
**What you say:** *"Our AI figured out material science tradeoffs on its own. It learned that Tensile Strength and Elongation at Break are negatively correlated — you can't make something extremely strong without making it less stretchy."*

### Graph 4: Eco-Score vs Properties
**What you say:** *"This is the core mission. It proves mathematically that you do not have to sacrifice structural strength to be eco-friendly. High eco-score materials match the tensile strength of standard petroleum plastics."*

### Graph 5: Residual Distributions
**What you say:** *"This analyses every single mistake our AI makes. The tight bell curve centered at zero proves no fundamental bias — when it's wrong, the error is tiny and mathematically random."*

## 8. Live Demo Script for Judges 🎤

**Step 1:** Open two terminals:
```bash
# Terminal 1
venv/bin/python -m uvicorn src.api:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2
cd frontend && npm run dev
```
Then open **http://localhost:5173**

**Step 2:** Say: *"We invented a brand new bio-based material right now."* → Adjust sliders → Hit **⚡ Run Ensemble Prediction**

**Step 3:** Move your mouse around the generated cards so they *tilt in 3D*. Say: *"We built a fully interactive 3D liquid-glass interface. Both the Radar Chart AND the metrics appear simultaneously, showing the full Material DNA plus exactly how confident the AI is in its prediction."*

**Step 4:** Click **🌱 Green**. Type "ABS". Hit Find Alternatives. Move your mouse around the cyan cards. Say: *"Standard ABS plastic has an eco-score of 0.00. In under 1 second, our AI calculated the multidimensional distance across 5 distinct physical properties to find 3 fully bio-based alternatives with up to 97%+ true structural match."*

**Step 5:** Run `make evaluate` in a terminal — open the `results/` folder and show the 5 graphs.

**Step 6 (bonus):** Run `make predict` in a terminal for the premium CLI interface with confidence bars and PDB molecule export.
